# asianamsurvey

## Overview
The `asianamsurvey` package is designed to streamline the analysis of survey data, with a specific focus on demographic and self-reported response surveys. It includes tools for data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and summarization, making it easier for researchers and statisticians to extract meaningful insights from complex survey datasets.

## Why Use This Package?
- Create customizable scatter plots for survey data
- Generate proportion tables for categorical variables
- Handle different types of data structures efficiently
- Convert survey responses to numeric scales systematically
- Process categorical variables with custom numeric mappings
- Built-in support for survey data analysis
- Comprehensive error handling and input validation
- Consistent and well-documented interface

## Installation
You can install this package from GitHub:
```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yourusername/yourpackagename")
```

## Usage
Here are some quick examples of what you can do with this package:

### Scatter Plots
```r
# Create a scatter plot of survey data
scatter(asian_american,
        x = "age",
        y = "income",
        color = "education",
        title = "Income by Age and Education Level",
        add_trendline = TRUE)
```

### Proportion Tables
```r
# Create a proportion table for survey responses
proptable(asian_american,
         x = education,
         y = english_speaking,
         include_total = TRUE,
         digits = 3)
```

### Survey Levels
```r
# Convert ordinal responses to numeric values
data <- data.frame(proficiency = c("Well", "Not at all", NA, "Not well", "Very well"))
response_scale <- c("Not at all", "Not well", "Well", "Very well")
data <- surveylevels(data, 
                    column = "proficiency", 
                    ordered_levels = response_scale)
```

### Make Numeric
```r
# Convert categorical responses with custom mapping
data <- data.frame(spouse = c("Living with spouse", "Not living with spouse", NA))
data <- makenumeric(data, 
                    column = "spouse",
                    true_values = "Living with spouse",
                    true_number = 1,
                    false_value = 0,
                    na_value = -1)
```

## Dataset: asian_american
The package includes one  example datasets: Asian American survey data with demographic and socioeconomic variables
### Description:
This dataset contains survey responses from the "Asian American Quality of Life" study conducted in Austin, capturing demographic, household, and quality-of-life metrics to assess the needs and preferences of Asian American communities. We have wrangled it so as to only include information regarding their reflections on their immigration and acculturation experiences, emotional well-being, and access to social and community resources.

- **Overview**:
  - Entries: 2,609
  - Columns: 231
  - Purpose: Analyze and improve quality of life for Asian American populations.

- **Key Information**:
  - Demographics: Age, Gender, Ethnicity, Marital Status, Education Level
  - Immigration and Acculturation: English Proficiency, Cultural Warning
  - Emotional Well-Being: Thoughts on Depression and Related Aspects
  - Social and Community Resources: Closeness to Family and Friends

### Source:
Data is from the "Asian American Quality of Life" study by the City of Austin.
